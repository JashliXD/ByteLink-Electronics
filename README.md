Execute the application's core functionality by executing the 'main.py' script, unlocking the full potential of the main app and providing users with a rich and interactive experience. It can also be a server as well!
## Database
Empower your application with essential tables by running the 'test.py' script, crucial for creating a robust and structured database foundation that aligns with your project's vital data requirements.

## NOTE!

This software or codebase, unfortunately, lacks optimization in its design, potentially leading to suboptimal performance and susceptibility to various security threats. Notably, its vulnerability extends to the risk of encountering slow execution times, making it susceptible to malicious attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and SQL Injection. As a result, it is strongly advised to prioritize optimization efforts and implement robust security measures to fortify the system against potential risks and enhance overall performance and resilience.
